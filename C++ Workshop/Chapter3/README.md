Chapter3 - Built-in Data Types
===
This chapter went over a few things:

1. arrays vectors and data storage
2. structs and classes
3. public vs private vs protected

The assignment at the end of the chapter was to use these elements to create a user entry application to record user name and age.
You also had to create a function to look up users by ID.
