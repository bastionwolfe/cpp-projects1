- It is a free book. Ironically it was in a bundle of books for C++ I paid for through humble bundle. This bundle will be used to push these projects and my learning.


There is a total of 13 Chapters. Each one will have a few exercises and a final project to demonstrate understanding at the end. I will only post the project from the end and only the exercises if I get stuck on them.
