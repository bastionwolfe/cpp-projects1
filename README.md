This is a folder to showcase and record my travels through c++ projects and other such things. current project forecast:
 I was doing a weekly update basis but I found a bundle of books with projects in them. I will be working through that instead. I will try to post consistently on them. 
===

# Hello world
- the start of it all

# C++ workshop - Packt
- First work book I will be going through. They have examples of code in it then a project to do to practice said examples

== Last words ==
- All of this will be done without the use of A.I.
- If A.I. is used, it will be to explain concepts and ideas. I will comment above and below the code I created that I consulted an AI about.
- This is to be used to showcase my own work and not that of A.I.
